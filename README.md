# Naive Bayes Classifier
This is a machine learning basic
 * Read the code comments to see what happens.  Training and test data are written in the code.  To try with other data, add user input capability or just edit the code.
 * Zero failure rate on the tests here.
 * Found .03% error rate on a large dataset.
 
# Set Tools
This code takes input data, splits it into sets and does basic set and statistical functions. 
 * To try a live version of this, go to http://daveswanson.info/stat/index.html
 * Use the text area for pasting data: any whitespace or comma-separated list of numbers
 * For more than one set you can add a vertical bar like this: |
 * Splits sets at each bar, tells you the union, intersection and cardinality, plus it does all the statistics work below on both the original inputs (with duplicates) and the union set (no duplicates)

# Statistics Basics
Lists statistical attributes of a dataset.  
 * This code sorts data, sums it, finds the mean, the median, standard deviations, quartiles and outliers.  There is also a crude histogram-like function for seeing skews etc.

# Statistics Discrete Distributions
Input fields on the HTML file. 
 * Binomial distribution, hyper-geometric, poisson, and negative binomial.
