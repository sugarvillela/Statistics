# Statistics
The most basic job of statistics is to list attributes of a dataset 
 * This code sorts data, sums it, finds the mean, the median, standard deviations, quartiles and outliers.  There is also a crude histogram-like function for seeing skews etc.
 * Use the text area for pasting data: any whitespace or comma-separated list of numbers
